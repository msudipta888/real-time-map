# Map Explorer

Map Explorer is a web application that allows users to find routes between two locations and explore nearby places of interest. It uses real-time data and provides an interactive map interface for seamless navigation and location discovery.

## Features

- **Route Finder**: Display routes between two user-specified locations.
- **Nearby Places**: Show nearby points of interest such as cafes, parks, and more around selected locations.
- **Map Types**: Toggle between different map views (e.g., satellite, street, terrain).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Leverage Socket.IO for real-time data on location changes.
- **Interactive UI**: Icons and map controls for easy navigation.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + React
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Map Library**: Leaflet.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing location data)
- **Deployment**:
  - Frontend: Netlify
  - Backend: Render
